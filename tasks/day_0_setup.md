### 🗓️ Day 0: Setup & Bootstrap
*   [ ] Install/verify ESP-IDF `v5.x` is sourced correctly in the terminal.
*   [ ] `git init tb_interview && cd tb_interview`
*   [ ] Create initial repo structure: `mkdir main thingsboard screenshots` and `touch README.md docker-compose.yml main/app_main.c`.
*   [ ] Flash the `hello_world` example from ESP-IDF to **both** ESP32-S3 boards to confirm the toolchain, flashing, and monitoring are all working.
