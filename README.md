## Getting Started (Detailed Setup)

### Prerequisites

- [ESP-IDF v5.4.1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.4.1/esp32s3/get-started/index.html)
- An ESP32-S3 development board

### Build and Flash

1.  **Set the Target Chip**:
    ```bash
    idf.py set-target esp32s3
    ```

2.  **Build and Flash the Firmware**:
    Connect the ESP32-S3 board and run the following command, replacing `/dev/ttyUSB0` with your device's serial port if necessary.
    ```bash
    idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash
    ```

3.  **Monitor the Output**:
    To view the log output from the device, run:
    ```bash
    idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 monitor
    ```

## Troubleshooting

### SSL/TLS Certificate Issues

**Expected Log Messages (Success):**

**First Boot (Initial Setup):**
```
I (451) PROVISIONING_EXAMPLE: CA certificate not found in NVS, initializing...
I (451) PROVISIONING_EXAMPLE: CA certificate stored in NVS successfully
I (451) PROVISIONING_EXAMPLE: ThingsBoard/Mosquitto CA certificate initialized successfully
I (451) PROVISIONING_EXAMPLE: No Wi-Fi credentials found, starting provisioning mode
I (621) PROVISIONING_EXAMPLE: WiFi AP started. SSID:ESP32-Provisioning password:password
```

**Subsequent Boots (Smart Boot):**
```
I (451) PROVISIONING_EXAMPLE: CA certificate already exists in NVS, skipping initialization
I (451) PROVISIONING_EXAMPLE: Wi-Fi credentials found, connecting directly
I (451) PROVISIONING_EXAMPLE: Connecting to stored Wi-Fi network: YourSSID
I (24391) PROVISIONING_EXAMPLE: CA certificate loaded from security NVS namespace
I (24881) PROVISIONING_EXAMPLE: MQTT_EVENT_CONNECTED
```

**Common SSL/TLS Errors:**

1. **"CA certificate not found in NVS"**
   - **Cause**: Certificate not properly stored or NVS corruption
   - **Solution**: Flash updated firmware with automatic certificate initialization

2. **"SSL/TLS error occurred - error code: 0x8010"**
   - **Cause**: Certificate validation failure or expired certificate
   - **Solution**: Verify MQTT broker certificate matches stored CA certificate

3. **"MQTT connection failed"**
   - **Cause**: Incorrect MQTTS port or SSL configuration
   - **Solution**: Ensure MQTT broker uses port 8883 and matches certificate

### Memory Issues
- **Low heap warning**: Device has ~323KB free at startup
- **Certificate storage**: Requires ~2KB NVS space per certificate (one-time write)
- **Boot optimization**: Certificate initialization skipped on subsequent boots for faster startup
- **Monitor**: Use `esp_get_free_heap_size()` for memory tracking

### Certificate Management
- **First Boot**: Automatically initializes and stores CA certificate in NVS
- **Subsequent Boots**: Detects existing certificate and skips initialization (faster boot time)
- **Memory Efficient**: Certificate written only once, reducing NVS wear
- **Manual Reset**: To force certificate re-initialization, erase NVS: `idf.py erase-flash`

### Network Troubleshooting
- **Wi-Fi connection**: LED shows blue during connection, green when successful
- **MQTTS connection**: LED turns red on SSL/TLS failures
- **Telemetry**: Check for `MQTT_EVENT_PUBLISHED` messages every 5 seconds

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: What's the difference between MQTT and MQTTS?
**A:** 
- **MQTT** (port 1883) = Unencrypted, insecure communication
- **MQTTS** (port 8883) = Encrypted with SSL/TLS certificates (what this project uses)

### Q: Do I need to generate certificates manually?
**A:** The ESP32 firmware includes the CA certificate automatically. You only need to generate server certificates for your MQTT broker.

### Q: Why does the ESP32 connect automatically after the first setup?
**A:** The firmware implements smart boot logic:
- **First boot**: No credentials ‚Üí starts provisioning mode
- **After setup**: Credentials stored ‚Üí connects directly to Wi-Fi
- **Certificate optimization**: CA certificate stored once, reused on subsequent boots

### Q: How do I reset the ESP32 to provisioning mode?
**A:** Run `idf.py erase-flash` to clear all NVS data (Wi-Fi credentials and certificates). The device will return to provisioning mode on next boot.

### Q: Does the device always start in provisioning mode?
**A:** No! The device only starts provisioning mode if no Wi-Fi credentials are stored. After initial setup, it connects directly to the configured network.
